<pre>
Cover Explaination: 
it will occupy all of area of the parent box, not leaving a pixel.

If size of picture size will not be equal to size of box, in ratio, 
some part of pic will be hidden/cropped.

--
you don't need to resize a pic, simply do 
background-size: contain;

--
The difference between contain and 100%

‘contain’
Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio, 
to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the 
background positioning area.

’%’
let's you zoom in zoom out as per your like
     
  If you use "background-size:100%;" the img will be scaled to fill the width.

If you use "background-size:auto 100%;"  it will be scaled to fill the height.
