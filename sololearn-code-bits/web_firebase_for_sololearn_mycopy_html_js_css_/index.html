                        Welcome to my Firebase in Sololearn tutorial! I see many questions in the Q&amp;A that ask about using
                        a database or hosting image files. By the end of this tutorial, you will be ready to use both!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let me preface this with something that many people may be concerned about as of right now. Firebase is
                        completely <b>FREE</b> to use, as long as you stay within the free tier of usage. For users on Sololearn,
                        their projects will most likely never reach into the paid tier usage amounts. For the Firestore database you
                        get 50,000 reads per day. For image storage, you are allowed up to 1GB of bandwidth per day, which is a LOT
                        for small images. If you reach those amounts, Firebase won't charge you; they will simply deny requests until
                        the next day starts. Awesome, right?! Let's continue!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Start by creating a Firebase account by going to the link <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">here</a>.
                        Once you have set up an account, you can go to your Firebase console which may look something like the below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="firebaseConsole" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Click Add Project to start your first Firebase project and then give it name. As you can see below, I have
                        named my project 'SLFirebase'.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="createProject" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Click continue. The next page will suggest some powerful analytics tools that you can use for your project.
                        For the purposes of this demo I will not be opting in to these analytics tools, but feel free to use them
                        for your project. Click Create Project and your project will be automatically set up by Firebase. When you
                        click Continue, you will be taken to your project's overview page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To use Firebase in a Sololearn web code, you will need to add a web app to your project. This will create
                        a config file that your JavaScript will load to let Firebase know that the project has been set up properly.
                        On your project's overview page, click the 'Add app' button near the top and select Web, which looks like an
                        HTML tag icon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see below, I have named my web app 'SLWebApps'. You also have the option to host your web app on
                        Google's Firebase servers. This is a great option when or if you want to release a web app to the public. We
                        are going to be using Sololearn to host our code, so I will leave my hosting checkbox unchecked.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="nameWebapp" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When you click 'Register app', the following pages will walk through some helpful instructions. They include some
                        HTML code snippets that are needed to load the Firebase JavaScript SDK's as well as how to load your app's
                        config, which will go in the JavaScript tab of your Sololearn web code. You can see an example below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="webappConfig" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Notice in the above image that the Firebase JavaScript SDK is linked via the gstatic CDN. This tag will go
                        in the HTML tab of your Sololearn web code. You can place it in the head tag. Placing it at the end of
                        the body will ensure that your page loads faster, but that won't work for Sololearn. We will also need two
                        additional tags to include the Firestore SDK and the Storage SDK. See the image below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="jsCdnScriptTags" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This concludes the setup portion. Join me in the next section to start adding a database!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="database" class="section primary-theme">
                <div>
                    <span class="sub-title-1-text">Creating a database</span>
                </div>
                <hr/>
                <div class="normal-text section-content">
                    <p>
                        To add a database to your project, all you need to do is make a few clicks. On your project overview page, find
                        the side navigation to the left (for mobile, just tap the menu burger at the top left) and click on Cloud
                        Firestore. This will bring up a page that gives you a lot of information about Firestore, including a video.
                        There is another option for a database called Realtime Database. This option will work just as well, but I
                        choose to use Firestore because it has a much more manageable document storage for more complex, hierarchical
                        data. To add Firestore, click the Create database button.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="createDatabaseBtn" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the image below, you will see the page after you click to create the database. I will start my database in
                        production mode, so that read and write access is denied to every request. This allows me to take my time and
                        implement the proper security rules before I allow anyone to access my database. Because your project config
                        is public information, anyone who uses it can read or write to your database if you don't have good security
                        rules in place. I'll go over those in more detail, but for now, hit next to continue.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="createDatabasePage1" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Click to continue on the next page. That page just shows you the location of your storage options that you
                        selected when creating your project. I have nam5 (us central) selected for my project, if you must know. After
                        that, you should land on your Firestore page. Here is where we start to learn about storage and using the
                        Firestore SDK API. I am not going to allow any writing to my database, even to authenticated users, so this page
                        is where I will manually create documents to read from in this Sololearn code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firestore has a great graphical user interface for adding data to your Firestore database, which makes creating
                        test data extremely easy. Let's start by creating our first collection. Just click the plus icon next to
                        'Start collection'. I'm going to be making a book collection as an example, so I'll name the collection 'books'.
                        You have the choice to add the collection's first document, which I will do and is shown below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="addFirstDocument" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You can think of a document as JSON. Each book in our collection will have a title, author, and published
                        timestamp. When you click save, the collection will be created and the first document will be added. I chose
                        to use an automatically generated document id because I won't be searching books based on the id - ideally,
                        I will be able to search and find books based on the fields within the document, like title and author.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we can get into some code! You can find the documentation for the Firestore API
                        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore">here</a>. Feel free to explore that
                        if you feel my explanations aren't enough. Before we start, you will need to update your Firestore security rules.
                        The image below has what you need in order to read the documents from the JavaScript API. You can find the security
                        rules for your database by clicking on the Rules tab on your Firestore page.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="firestoreRules" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This rule will only allow reads on your books collection. To learn more about security rules and how to structure
                        them for your projects, go <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure">here</a>.
                        <span class="code-span-in-primary">{book}</span> is like a variable that allows any book within the books collection
                        to be matched in the rule. You can also use it like a variable in the rule block, but since we don't need to, I won't
                        be doing that here. Once you've made those changes to the rule, click publish. Firestore will tell you that it
                        may take some time for the rule to propagate throughout their system, so don't be alarmed if you don't see results
                        immediately from your queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have the proper rules in place, we can begin using the API to fetch our data. Below is the code I will
                        use to fetch our first book entry, Dune.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block-secondary">
<pre>const db = firebase.firestore();
const booksCollection = db.collection("books");

booksCollection.where("title", "==", "Dune").get()
    .then((querySnapshot) => {
        querySnapshot.forEach((docRef) => {
            console.log(docRef.data().author);// Frank Herbert
        })
    })
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        First we get the database reference with <span class="code-span-in-primary">firebase.firestore()</span>. When working
                        with Firestore, you really only need to call this once. After that, you can pass around the variable you set it to
                        like any other variable. Next, I get the books collection reference. Collection references have methods available to
                        refine your database search, just like a SQL query. I am using the <span class="code-span-in-primary">where()</span>
                        method to search on documents that have a title of 'Dune', which should only be one. After refining the fetch with
                        where, you must then call <span class="code-span-in-primary">get()</span> to make the actual call to the database.
                        Using <span class="code-span-in-primary">get()</span> returns what's called a
                        <span class="code-span-in-primary">QuerySnapshot</span>. The QuerySnapshot is an iterable item that contains a list
                        of <span class="code-span-in-primary">QueryDocumentSnapshot</span>s. To learn more, read the documentation
                        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.QuerySnapshot">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we iterate over our list of QueryDocumentSnapshots, we can read information about the document by using the
                        <span class="code-span-in-primary">data()</span> method. This method returns the document as a JavaScript object,
                        which is how I'm able to access the author property with the dot accessor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have created a database, filled it with a document, and fetched that document, you have the power to
                        do so much more! Experiment by adding more documents to your books collection, or create an entirely new collection.
                        When you are ready, maybe you can even try writing to the database. Just remember to keep your code private until you
                        have implemented some proper authentication. Firebase has an authentication service that makes it really easy, so
                        do some research in that area if you want to learn more.

                        Have you ever wanted to save images from your computer or phone in a place where you could use them for your projects
                        on Sololearn? If so, this is the tutorial for you. Every image on this page is hosted in my Firebase Storage database.
                        After going through this tutorial, you will be able to do the same. It's extremely simple and takes about 10 minutes
                        total. Just make sure to finish the <a href="#setup">setup section</a> above before you begin.

                    <p>
                        To add storage - specifically image storage - to your Firebase project, go to your project's overview page and click
                        'Storage' on the navigation menu to the left. Mobile friends, tab the menu button in the upper left to show
                        the side nav. Then click the button near the top of that page to add Storage to your project. If it asks you to
                        select your geographic location, the default option has always worked for me - nam5 (us central).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have added Storage to your Firebase project, you can begin uploading images to use in your web projects on
                        Sololearn. Before you do that, click the 'Rules' tab on the Storage page. Below is an image of the rule that I have
                        in place for my Storage. This will deny any requests to your Storage bucket that attempt to make any changes. What
                        you want is for other unauthenticated users on Sololearn to see, or 'read', the images that you have uploaded.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img id="storageRules" src=""/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If you want to learn more about security rules, go to
                        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure">this</a> link. Now that your read-only
                        rule is in place, go back to the Files tab and click 'Upload file' to select images from your computer or phone. Make
                        sure that is has a name you like before uploading, because you won't be able to edit the name after it has been
                        uploaded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you have upload an image or two, you can use the Storage API to fetch them. The code below will show you what I've
                        done to fetch the images for this Sololearn code. Feel free to look at the JavaScript for this code as well!
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block-primary">
<pre>const storage = firebase.storage();
storage.ref("storageRules.png").getDownloadURL()
    .then((url) => {
        document.querySelector("#storageRules).src = url;
    });</pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        First, we get the reference to the storage object using <span class="code-span-in-secondary">firebase.storage()</span>.
                        I upload an image called 'storageRules.png', and I placed it in the root directory of my storage. You also have the
                        option to create folders, which is fantastic for using in combination with your security rules. Some folders can be
                        private and others public; you get to choose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After creating the reference using <span class="code-span-in-secondary">ref()</span>, you can use the
                        <span class="code-span-in-secondary">getDownloadURL()</span> to fetch the download URL for that specifc image reference.
                        The download URL can be used in the src property of an img tag. That is what you see when I query the HTML document for
                        an element with an id of storageRules. That element is an image tag, and I set its src property to the url that comes
                        back from the Storage request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
